# Netresearch Logo

This repository contains the [Netresearch](https://www.netresearch.de) logo in several variations.

## Inkscape source files

The svg files for [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org) are located directly in the root directory. Each variant (landscape and portrait) are also present with *_measures* - both, the file with measures and without are the same apart from that in the measures file the "measures" layer is visible and in the other not.

## Web versions

The web versions are versions without bleed, metadata, ids, hidden objects/layers and other editor related information leading to less than the half of the original file size.

They are created with Inkscape like this: File -> Save copy -> Optimized SVG

They can be embedded into webpages directly via github.io - e.g. [https://netresearch.github.io/logo/web/portrait.svg](https://netresearch.github.io/logo/web/portrait.svg)
